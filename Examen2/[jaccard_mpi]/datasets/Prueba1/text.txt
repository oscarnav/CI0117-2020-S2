MPI (Message Passing Interface) is a specification for a standard library for message passing that was defined by the MPI Forum, a broadly based group of parallel computer vendors, library writers, and applications specialists.
Multiple implementations of MPI have been developed.
We document its portability and performance and describe the architecture by which these features are simultaneously achieved.
We also discuss the set of tools that accompany the free distribution of MPICH, which constitute the beginnings of a portable parallel programming environment.
A project of this scope inevitably imparts lessons about parallel computing, the specification being followed, the current hardware and software environment for parallel computing, and project management; we describe those we have learned.
Finally, we discuss future developments for MPICH, including those necessary to accommodate extensions to the MPI Standard now being contemplated by the MPI Forum.
In very simple terms, it is the use of multiple resources, in this case, processors, to solve a problem. 
This type of programming takes a problem, breaks it down into a series of smaller steps, delivers instructions, and processors execute the solutions at the same time. 
It is also a form of programming that offers the same results as concurrent programming but in less time and with more efficiency. 
Many computers, such as laptops and personal desktops, use this programming in their hardware to ensure that tasks are quickly completed in the background.
